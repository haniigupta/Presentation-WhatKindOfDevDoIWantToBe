# Who are all these people? What kind of role do I want?

This repository contains issues, links, and materials used for a workshop
that explores different types of software development roles.

### Description:
Front-end developer? Back-end developer? Data engineer? Security? Data scientist?

Join me to help you get an idea of what kind of developer role pursues what kinds of tasks. We will work through bugs in a simulated environment to build an idea of what working is like in each of these jobs.
