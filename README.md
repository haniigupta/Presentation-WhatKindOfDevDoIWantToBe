# Who are all these people? What kind of role do I want?

This is a collection of the issues, links and materials I will use to complete a workshop about the different types of developers that students are choosing from.

### Description:
Front-end developer? Back-end developer? Data engineer? Security? DevOps? Full-stack? Auto? QA?

Join me to help you get an idea of what kind of developer you want to pursue! We will take 10 minutes for each sub-sectiom, work through a real-life bug, and thus build an idea of what working is like in each of these jobs!
