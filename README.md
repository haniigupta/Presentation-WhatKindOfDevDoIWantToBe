# Who are all these people? What kind of role do I want?

This is a collection of the issues, links and materials I will use to complete a workshop about the different types of developers that students are choosing from.

### Description:
Front-end developer? Back-end developer? Data engineer? Security? Data scientist?

Join me to help you get an idea of what kind of developer role pursues what kinds of tasks. We will work through bugs in a simulated environment to build an idea of what working is like in each of these jobs.
